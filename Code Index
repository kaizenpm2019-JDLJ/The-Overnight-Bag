      No one plans to stay this long.

    <p>
      The overnight bag gets heavier. Days blur together.
      You learn things you never wanted to learn.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The Overnight Bag</strong> exists to collect and share the hard-won
      knowledge families gain when hospital stays stretch on — waiting,
      adjusting, and showing up anyway.

    <p>
      This is not medical advice.  
      This is lived experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Take what you need. Leave what you don’t.  
      And know you’re not alone.
